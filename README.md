Demonstrated Skills:

    -Uses breadth first search on a graph to traverse word lists and created shortest path
    -Uses React Redux to handle overall state of words and guesses. 
    -Uses React Router to control the links and flow of multiple webpages in the site.
    -Uses React Hooks like useState, useReducer, and useEffect to handle initialization and life cycle methods.
    -Uses the create-react-app to start the backbone of this project.
    -Uses React.js to handle all of the frontend using states, props and components with function based components.
    -Styled with classic CSS with the beautiful design of an electrical engineer with the fashion sense of a lawn mower. 

Future Ways to Improve:

    -Currently working on a login system using Oath for Facebook, Google, and custom login with backend designed in Node.js and MongoDB using mongoose.
